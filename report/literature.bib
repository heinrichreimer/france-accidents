  abstract = {We empirically examine the relationship between traffic congestion and deaths in road accidents at the city level. We use panel data from 129 large cities in Europe for the period 2008â€“2017. We find strong evidence of a quadratic relationship between congestion and deaths in accidents, using both parametric and non-parametric econometric techniques. The threshold point at which the relationship between congestion and deaths in accidents is reversed and becomes positive occurs when congestion results in about a 30 per cent increase in travel time compared to a free flow situation. For most congested cities, any effective measure to contain congestion may also lead to better safety outcomes.}

  Abstract                 = {The goal of this chapter is to help authors recognize and avoid a set of pitfalls that recur in many rejected information visualization papers, using a chronological model of the research process. Selecting a target paper type in the initial stage can avert an inappropriate choice of validation methods. Pitfalls involving the design of a visual encoding may occur during the middle stages of a project. In a later stage when the bulk of the research is finished and the paper writeup begins, the possible pitfalls are strategic choices for the content and structure of the paper as a whole, tactical problems localized to specific sections, and unconvincing ways to present the results. Final-stage pitfalls of writing style can be checked after a full paper draft exists, and the last set of problems pertain to submission.},
